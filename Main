Explanation:

Main: The class where all the different functions are put together in a logical order, only with "function()", nothing more

I will divide the whole interface code into the different classes, so we can actually start coding with logical functions

basic things to use:

raw_input is the same as input(), the only difference is: raw_input was for string inputs in Python, but  that was Python version 2.x
-> it is better to use only input(), I was just so used to raw_input

AND: Please your variable names wisely, so everyone knows what they mean
AND: Please write comments describing what the function does: #comments
