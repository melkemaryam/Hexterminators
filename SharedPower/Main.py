#Explanation:

#Main: The class where all the different functions are put together in a logical order, only with "function()", nothing more

#I will divide the whole interface code into the different classes, so we can actually start coding with logical functions

#basic things to use:

#if you want to get something from the user, please use input() and convert it into the right data type, raw_input does not work here

#AND: Please choose your variable names wisely, so everyone knows what they mean
#AND: Please write comments describing what the function does: #comments
#AND: if something does not work, you can just make a comment block out of it, so you do not have to delete it
